                 "treacherous seas, seeking fortune and adventure at every turn. But, fate had other plans for this "
                 "old sea dog. A fierce storm, the likes of which I'd never seen, swept me ship off course and dashed "
                 "it upon the jagged rocks of this cursed isle. For years I've been marooned here, a castaway left to "
                 "fend for meself. But fear not, for I've learned a thing or two about survival in these harsh and "
                 "unforgiving lands. Ye see, survival ain't just about strength and skill; it's about adaptin' to yer "
                 "surroundings, makin' do with what ye have, and never losin' hope. Take heed, young ones, "
                 "for I'll share with ye the secrets of me survival.",
                 "First and foremost, ye must master the art of findin' water. Without ye will not survive the day. "

                 "food. The sea be teemin' with life, me hearties, so cast yer lines and nets and reap the bounty "
                 "that lies beneath the waves. And don't be afraid to forage the land for fruits and berries, "
                 "for nature provides for those who know where to look. But survival ain't just about yer daily "
                 "bread; it's about stayin' sharp in both mind and body. Keep yer wits about ye at all times, "
                 "for danger lurks in every shadow. Train yer body to endure the rigors of this harsh land, "
                 "for only the strong survive in the end.",
                 "And finally, me lads, never lose sight of yer true goal. Ye may be stranded on this island for now, "
                 "but never give up hope of escapin' its clutches and returnin' to the open sea. Keep in mind that "
                 "time is essential for survival, use it wisely. Repair yer boat, gather yer supplies, and when the "
                 "time is right, set sail for freedom once more. So heed me words well, me hearties, and ye'll find "
                 "that even in the darkest of times, there be light to guide ye home. For as long as there be breath "
                 "in yer lungs and fire in yer hearts, ye'll never be truly lost at sea.<br>Now, enough of me "
